flanders_addr_export
====================

Contains an export of the AGIV CRAB data and a comparison to the current OSM data as CSV files that can be read by JOSM and carry the right OSM tags. 

License
-------

All *.full.csv and *.wiki files are direct programatical transformations of the AGIV CRAB database (https://download.agiv.be/Producten/Detail?id=102&title=CRAB_adresposities). So are published here under the same Flemish Open Data license (license text readable in Dutch on the above site).

All *.diff.csv files show the difference between OSM data and AGIV CRAB data. So as a derived work from both datasets, the data falls under the most restricting license, wich is ODBL (http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/)
